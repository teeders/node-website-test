The world is massive and there is always something to be doing in the game, whether that be questing against monsters, player killing (pvp) or even role-playing.

There are no items, there are mounts to move around and there are no set champions where they only can be in one lane.  Players are still toxic at times but there is no way to communicate with the enemy team and exeperience is shared with the team so no one player gets fed or overpowered."

      "gamedesc": "Dead by Daylight is my favorite game at the moment. It is available on steam. It is 4 survivors against 1 supernatural killer that hunts down the survivors who are in turn trying to repair and power up 5 generators.  Survivors are sacrificed to The Entity by the Killer if they are placed on a large meat hook.  Survivors can save other survivors or decide to leave them on the hook to die.  There is no chat in game, only in the lobby between the survivors, who do not know what killer they will be facing until in game and they see for themselves.  Killers all have a special ability unique to that killer.  Killers include The Shape aka Michael Myers, The Nightmare aka Freddy Krueger and The Doctor; which shocks the survivors within range and sends them into madness. Despite killers being super powerful and not able to be attacked, it is hard to get all 4 survivors sacrificed though like with any game there are people that are salty when they lose.  Leavers happen regularly as whatever items a survivor is carrying will be lost if they are sacrificed."
